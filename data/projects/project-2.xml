        Together with a Scrum team I was responsible for the frontend and backend of the website. The website design contains twoÂ forms built by wordpress plug-in called CF7. The code needed to be refactored to make it cleaner and bug free, and the SASS code was made DRY, using SASS mixins and extends. In a second step I was involved in writing JavaScript and PHP code in order to customize the behaviour of the CF7 form. More specifically data from the contact form were inserted into the database.
