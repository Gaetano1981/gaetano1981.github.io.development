			Together with a Scrum team I was responsible for tasks related to new Competa IT official website frontend. I built skewed borders elements overlapping with skewed border images as background. For these tasks I did use the SVG to include images and applying path clipping. Other tasks were to create website sections in which I did use the flexboxes to properly align elements, and mixins in order to avoid repeated code across the project.
