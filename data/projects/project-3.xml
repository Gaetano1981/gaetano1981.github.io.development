    <project-description>
        The Headcount project was built to provide an overview of company employees, trainees and interns classifing them by category, hiring dates and more attributes. A good data rapresentation was achieved by D3.js library for graphs. With a Scrum team I was responsible for building styled graphs. The frontend was implemented using AngularJS 1.6 and I was responsible for building an AngularJS controller and a service in order to make the graph connected to API data.
