<!-- Not the best implementation here. Instead of using ng-view I think
was better to use a custom directive and specify this htlm lines as 
directive template -->

<form>
	<textarea ng-model="contact_me_message_M" ng-change="UpdateMessage();" rows="4" cols="50" placeholder="send me an instant message!"></textarea>
</form>
